Aamazon Link Globalizer
======

This plugin will automatically rewrite all Amazon.com/Amzn.com links with an ASIN or keyword inside your posts
to point to the &lt;a href="http://www.affiliate-geo-target.com/amazon.html"&gt;A-FWD&lt;/a&gt; webservice. This webservice
will determine the users location (using IP Geolocation) and then forward them to their appropriate country store. &lt;br&gt;

Note: Woboq is sponsoring the server and bandwidth for the A-FWD GeoIP technology. In exchange for that, 1% of your visitors/clicks 
will be using our affiliate ID instead of yours. We will also add our ID if you don't specify one for a certain 
Amazon store your user is redirected to.
